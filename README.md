🔍 Project Overview: This project utilizes AI and machine learning, specifically neural networks, to recognize hand gestures and control a fan. Using Google’s Teachable Machine, we trained the system to recognize five distinct hand gestures, corresponding to:

Turn On and Turn Off the fan 💡
Increase Speed or Decrease Speed 📈📉
Set Speed to a specific level 🖐️

💡 Key Achievements:
We achieved 100% accuracy for each gesture class using a balanced dataset of 5000 images per gesture. Automated data collection ensured consistency and accuracy, with all samples captured from the CZone library. The system integrates ESP32 hardware, a camera module, and a fan interface to enable seamless gesture-based control in real-time.

🎯 Technologies and Approach:
Teachable Machine & OpenCV for gesture recognition ESP32 for fan control and IoT integration Python to implement image processing techniques Hand gesture recognition model trained with images for five classes: Paper, Rock, Scissors, Thumbs Up, and Up 📊 Outcome and Impact: This project demonstrated the feasibility of using AI-based gesture recognition to control home appliances, paving the way for hands-free and intuitive home automation. Such innovations have promising applications in improving the accessibility and efficiency of IoT systems.
